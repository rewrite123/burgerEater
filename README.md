Ok, so this project was a bit of a pain. Basically, because of my isp, I cannot use the remote sql server that heroku provides. 

It has to do with the fact that my isp is a public wifi provider, which means that I cannot access my sql server. So, you will have to run the server yourself.

I provided the neccessary sql files for you, and server.js has plenty of documentation on how the server part works. Most of it is automated anyway.
To run this program, run

"node main.js <ThePasswordForYourDB>"
  
That will start the server, and from there you can access it from /index.
  
Please excuse the lateness, I have had a lot of problems regarding the sql shit.
